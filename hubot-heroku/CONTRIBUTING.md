# Contributing - Make the robot smarter

Pull requests and issues rock by helping to improvem my shitty code. Please feel free to open an issue or hit me with a PR.

1. Understand the library's considerations (README.md). Feel free to open an issue to ask about a feature before building it.
2. :star: Code magic :star:
3. Add tests for the features
4. Make sure existing tests pass too. Generally, `npm test` (uses Mocha / Chai)
5. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]. Make sure you explain the motivation behind the PR.
